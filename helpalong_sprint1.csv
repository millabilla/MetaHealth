Then we can sign up as a google developer after agreeing to terms and conditions. From here we can make a project name and give the URL for our Azure website.

With this, we need a way to keep track of the things going on in our busy lives as well as things to take care of ourselves on a daily basis. The approach we are going to take is using a google account as the primary way to use this application. Once you have registered for this account, your google calendar will connected to the application. After this user story a registered user will be able to view the events on their calendar. This will require learning how to set up google calendar api with an ASP.net web application. The first thing we need to do is create a new cloud platform application, this will generate a client ID that we will use to connect our web application. Next, in order to begin using it will be installing Install-Package Google.Apis.Calendar.v3. Lastly, we will just have to write the code that will display all the events. Then we will test this to see if it works.  Since the google API will be connected after this story, this will make it easier in the future stories where we will be using google calendar in our application.  A user will eventually be able to add a list of events that we recommend for self care. They will also be able to add custom events that they want, as well as medication notifications. So this will help them remember to work on themselves as well as everything else.
